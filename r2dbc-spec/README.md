# Reactive Relational Database Connectivity Specification

This project contains the specification documentation for R2DBC.

You can build it by running the following Maven command:

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

The build generates documentation to `$(pwd)/target/static-resources` as HTML and PDF. 
If you've ran previously a build on `r2dbc-spi`, it will also contain the API documentation as Javadoc.

You can find the documentation sources at `src/main/asciidoc`.
